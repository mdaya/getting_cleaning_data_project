This repository hosts a script run_analysis.R that downloads and cleans a human 
activity recognition smartphones dataset.
The dataset was generated from a set of experiments which measured human 
activity using Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones.
The script downloads the data set, and then performs a number of steps to 
generate a single tidy data set (as ./data/movement.txt) that can be used for 
analyses. 
The original data contained separate training and testing data sets, and these 
data sets were combined. 
Only the mean and standard deviation variables were retained in the tidy 
data set.
A code book that describes the resultant tidy data set is also provided.
